    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Pani Literally translates to water and here the Puris are fried puffed
      crisp dough balls which are hollow. Generally, the water or pani is sour,
      tangy as well as spicy. This spicy pani is balanced with the addition of
      sweet tamarind chutney. <br /><br />This sweet chutney is called as Meetha
      (which means sweet) Pani. The spicy water is called as Teekha (which means
      spicy) Pani. Both are added in the puri along with the main filling which
      consists of boiled potatoes, cooked chickpeas, moong sprouts or a thick
      dry curry made from white peas which is called as Ragda.
